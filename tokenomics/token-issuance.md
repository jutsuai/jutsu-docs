# Token Issuance

## Reward Pool

### Purpose

The Reward Pool is designated to incentivize and reward developers, curators, and users who contribute meaningfully to the platform. It facilitates a performance-driven reward system that values quality, frequency, and impact of contributions.

### Allocation

45% of the total token supply will be reserved for the Reward Pool, ensuring a sustained ability to incentivize and reward contributions over time.

### Strategy

A formula-based distribution mechanism will adjust token issuance based on predefined platform subscriber pool metrics. This system will be subject to periodic reviews and adjustments to align with evolving platform goals and user engagement levels, ensuring sustainability and effectiveness of incentives.

### Implementation

To effectively implement the reward pool, we will establish a detailed process of new token issuance driven by the platform’s subscriber pool as well as periodic reviews designed to adjust the reward system based on platform needs.

#### Subscriber Based Issuance Mechanism

To balance the incentive structure and control token inflation, a dynamic subscriber-based token issuance mechanism will be introduced. This mechanism will adjust the number of tokens allocated to the Reward Pool based on the size of the subscriber pool. By linking the token issuance to the size of the subscriber base, the platform can ensure that incentives remain attractive as the user base grows, without causing excessive inflation.

#### Periodic Reviews

A governance committee will conduct quarterly reviews to assess the performance of the formula and make necessary adjustments. These reviews will be informed by platform data and user feedback, ensuring the reward system remains aligned with platform goals and user expectations.

#### Community Feedback Integration

An online feedback portal will be implemented to allow users to submit suggestions for improving the reward system. Regular reviews of this feedback will ensure that the reward distribution strategy remains responsive to community needs.

## Operational Reserve

### Strategy

A governance committee will oversee the reserve, with quarterly assessments to reallocate funds as needed based on operational milestones, financial forecasts, and strategic priorities. This dynamic financial management approach ensures that resources are optimally used for the platform’s growth and stability.

### Implementation

Implementing the operational reserve involves forming a governance committee, defining key milestones, and conducting financial forecasting to ensure appropriate fund allocations.

Metrics such as user acquisition rates, engagement metrics, and return on investment (ROI) will be tracked to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing efforts. Based on these metrics, strategies will be adjusted to optimize outcomes.

#### Feedback and Adjustments

Regular reviews will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of marketing initiatives. Adjustments will be made based on measurable outcomes and community feedback to ensure that marketing efforts are effective and aligned with platform goals.

## Stakeholder Incentives

### Purpose

Tokens for Stakeholder Incentives are used to align the long-term interests of investors, advisors, and early supporters with the platform's success, ensuring their ongoing commitment and support through vested interests.

### Allocation

15% of the total token supply is reserved for stakeholders, which helps in securing their support while preventing abrupt market fluctuations by implementing vesting schedules and lock-up periods.

### Strategy

Stakeholder tokens are distributed under a structured vesting plan that spans 2-4 years to prevent market flooding and ensure stakeholders are incentivized over the long term. The distribution strategy includes regular assessments to adjust vesting schedules based on individual and collective contributions to the platform’s success.

### Implementation

The implementation of stakeholder incentives involves creating a comprehensive vesting plan, establishing lock-up periods, and conducting regular assessments to ensure alignment with platform goals. This section outlines the specifics of each aspect.

#### Vesting Plan

The vesting plan for stakeholder incentives is designed to ensure a long-term commitment to the platform. Stakeholders will have their tokens vested over a period of 2 to 4 years, with tokens being released quarterly. For example, if a stakeholder is allocated 1,000 tokens to be vested over two years, they will receive 125 tokens each quarter. There will be an initial cliff period of one year, meaning stakeholders will not receive any tokens until they have been with the platform for at least one year. After this cliff period, the remaining tokens will be distributed quarterly. This plan ensures that stakeholders are rewarded for their sustained involvement and support.

#### Lock-Up Periods

To align stakeholders' interests with the long-term success of the platform, initial lock-up periods will be implemented. A lock-up period of 6 to 12 months will prevent stakeholders from selling or transferring their tokens during this initial period. After the initial lock-up, tokens will be gradually released according to the vesting schedule. For instance, if a stakeholder has a 12-month lock-up, they will start receiving their tokens quarterly after the lock-up period ends. This approach helps maintain market stability and ensures that stakeholders remain committed to the platform’s growth.

#### Regular Assessments

Regular assessments will be conducted to ensure the vesting and lock-up periods are effective and fair. The governance committee will perform quarterly reviews to assess the vesting schedules' effectiveness based on the platform’s performance, stakeholder contributions, and evolving market conditions. Detailed assessment reports will be published to maintain transparency, outlining the number of tokens vested, release dates, and any adjustments made. These reviews and reports ensure stakeholders understand the value of their contributions and the rationale behind any changes in the vesting plan.

#### Detailed Vesting Schedule

Each stakeholder will receive a personalized vesting schedule, providing clear visibility into the vesting process. For instance, an investor allocated 2,000 tokens over four years with a one-year cliff period will receive 500 tokens per year, distributed quarterly. Stakeholders will be regularly informed about their vesting schedules, including any changes made during the quarterly assessments. This detailed schedule helps stakeholders plan their contributions and align their efforts with the platform’s strategic goals.

## Initial Token Distribution

### Purpose

The Initial Token Distribution is intended to establish initial market liquidity and incentivize early developers who are critical to the platform's initial development and growth. This strategic distribution is designed to quickly ramp up a robust and productive developer ecosystem, while ensuring a broad and fair token distribution at launch.

### Allocation

5% of the total token supply is designated for initial distribution, with 2% allocated for the public sale and 3% specifically reserved for developer onboarding incentives. This targeted approach not only seeds the market with initial liquidity but also directly supports Jutsu’s goal of fostering an active and innovative developer community from the outset.

### Strategy

The public sale will be conducted in a staged and transparent manner, complying with regulatory guidelines to establish a baseline market value for the tokens. Simultaneously, the developer onboarding program will allocate tokens to early developers who sign up on Jutsu and are evaluated for their potential to contribute meaningfully to the platform. Developers will receive tokens as an initial grant after registering and having their first project approved, encouraging immediate and impactful participation. This strategy ensures that the tokens are not only distributed widely but are also strategically used to build and sustain the platform’s core functionalities and community engagement from the beginning.

### Implementation

To effectively implement the initial token distribution, we will conduct the public sale in stages, ensure regulatory compliance, and provide incentives for early developers.

#### Public Sale Stages

The public sale will be conducted in multiple stages, including a private pre-sale, a public pre-sale
