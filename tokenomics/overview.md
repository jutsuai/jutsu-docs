# Overview

The token economics of the Jutsu platform are designed to create a sustainable, incentivized ecosystem that supports the continuous development and deployment of intelligent software agents and decentralized applications. Central to this model is the Jutsu Token (JUT), an ERC-20 token that facilitates transactions, rewards contributions, and enables governance within the community. This section outlines the foundational principles of Jutsu's tokenomics, including the mechanisms for token issuance, allocation, and distribution, as well as the incentive structures that drive participation and engagement among developers, curators, and providers. By aligning economic incentives with platform growth and user engagement, Jutsu aims to build a robust, dynamic, and scalable ecosystem that fosters innovation and collaboration.
