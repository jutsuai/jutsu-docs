# Introduction

Welcome to Jutsu!

Jutsu is an advanced platform designed to empower developers and non-developers alike to create, deploy, and monetize intelligent agents. Our philosophy centers on augmenting human capabilities rather than replacing workers, aiming to create a future where AI works alongside humans to enhance productivity and innovation.

## Background

Jutsu envisions a future where intelligent agents are seamlessly integrated into daily workflows, enhancing human capabilities and fostering innovation. Our platform is designed to be inclusive, empowering individuals with varying levels of technical expertise to participate in the AI economy.

At Jutsu, we strive to create an environment that promotes:

- **Empowerment through Low-Code/No-Code Tools**: Our intuitive tools allow users without technical skills to create, deploy, and manage intelligent agents, democratizing AI development.

- **Flexible Integration with Multiple AI Models**: We support seamless integration with multiple AI model providers, enabling users to choose and switch between services without vendor lock-in.

- **Transparent and Fair Monetization Opportunities**: Builders can monetize their agents through micro-royalties, marketplace sales, and subscription models, ensuring fair compensation and encouraging active participation.

- **Ownership and Control for Builders**: We establish transparent systems for tracking agent ownership and usage, ensuring builders retain control over their creations.

- **Robust Safety and Verification**: Comprehensive verification processes ensure agents act safely and effectively, creating a secure environment for all users.

## Core Components

The Jutsu platform is built to serve and empower three primary types of participants: Builders, Consumers, Curators, and Providers. Here’s how each core component of the Jutsu platform caters to their needs:

### Builders

- **Builder Studio**: As a Builder, you have access to our creative core, which provides intuitive tools and workflows for creating, configuring, deploying, and monetizing intelligent agents. Whether you are using low-code/no-code solutions or diving deep into development, the Builder Studio is designed to support your journey from concept to deployment.

- **Monetization Opportunities**: List your agents in the Marketplace Hub and earn micro-royalties based on usage and engagement. The platform ensures you receive fair compensation for your contributions, providing financial incentives that encourage continuous innovation.

- **Collaboration and Community**: Engage with the Jutsu community through the Community Hub, where you can share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and receive support from peers and platform resources. Design multi-agent collaborations and leverage APIs and data sources to create sophisticated agentic pipelines.

### Consumers

**Marketplace**: As a Consumer, you can explore and utilize a wide variety of intelligent agents to automate and simplify tasks. The Marketplace Hub offers a user-friendly interface for browsing, subscribing to, and using agents tailored to your specific needs under a usage-based subscription model similar to Netflix.

**Continuous Improvement**: Benefit from the ongoing innovation and updates to agents driven by builder contributions and marketplace dynamics, ensuring you always have access to the latest and most effective tools.

### Curators

**Curator Hub**: As a Curator, you play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and safety of the platform’s content. Conduct thorough verification processes to ensure agents are safe, reliable, and effective. Your high reputation allows you to vet and organize contributions, ensuring only high-quality agents are accessible to users.

**Performance Rewards**: Earn tokens based on the accuracy and reliability of your reviews and approvals. The Curator Hub ensures that your contributions are recognized and rewarded, promoting accountability and high standards within the community.

### Providers

**Integration and Growth**: As a Provider, such as an AI model provider, you benefit from seamless integration with the Jutsu platform. Attract new builders and foster ecosystem growth through our Builder Hub, which lowers entry barriers and supports a wide range of AI models.
