Welcome to the Jutsu Terminology page! This guide will help you understand the key terms and concepts used throughout our platform and documentation.

## Agent
An autonomous software entity that performs tasks on behalf of users, leveraging AI models to operate intelligently and efficiently.

## AI Model
A pre-trained artificial intelligence algorithm provided by various vendors (e.g., OpenAI, Claude) that can be integrated into agents to enhance their capabilities.

## API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of protocols and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. In Jutsu, APIs enable agents to interact with external data sources and services.

## Bounty
A reward offered for completing specific tasks or projects within the Jutsu platform. Builders can earn tokens by successfully fulfilling these bounties.

## Decentralized
A system where control and decision-making are distributed among a network of participants rather than centralized in a single entity.

## ERC-20
A standard for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that ensures interoperability between different tokens and applications. The Jutsu Token (JUT) follows this standard.

## Governance
The process of making decisions about the rules and direction of the platform, often involving community voting and consensus.

## Low-Code/No-Code
Development approaches that allow users to create applications or agents with minimal or no programming knowledge, using intuitive interfaces and visual tools.

## Micro-Royalty
A small, continuous payment that builders receive based on the usage and engagement of their agents. This ensures fair compensation for their contributions.

## NFT (Non-Fungible Token)
A unique digital asset that represents ownership of a specific item or piece of content, often used to verify ownership and provenance in digital art and collectibles.

## Staking
The process of locking up tokens to support the operations of a blockchain network or platform, often earning rewards in return.

## Tokenomics
The economic model and structure governing the distribution, utilization, and management of tokens within the Jutsu platform.

## Smart Contract
A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, used to automate and enforce transactions on the blockchain.

## Validator
A participant in the blockchain network responsible for verifying transactions and maintaining the integrity of the ledger.

## Wallet
A digital tool used to store, manage, and transact cryptocurrencies and tokens. In Jutsu, wallets are used to hold JUT tokens and interact with the platform.
