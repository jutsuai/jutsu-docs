## Terminology

Welcome to the Jutsu Terminology page! This guide will help you understand the key terms and concepts used throughout our platform and documentation. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, this guide will provide you with clear definitions and explanations.

### General Terms

-   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.
-   **AI Agent**: An AI-powered software program that performs tasks, automates processes, and enhances productivity by leveraging artificial intelligence.
-   **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to allow computers to learn and make decisions without explicit programming.
-   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A subset of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.
-   **Deep Learning**: A type of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers, allowing the model to learn complex patterns.

### Jutsu-Specific Terms

-   **Agent**: An autonomous software entity that performs tasks on behalf of users, leveraging AI models to operate intelligently and efficiently.
-   **AI Model**: A pre-trained artificial intelligence algorithm provided by various vendors (e.g., OpenAI, Claude) that can be integrated into agents to enhance their capabilities.
-   **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of protocols and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. In Jutsu, APIs enable agents to interact with external data sources and services.
-   **Bounty**: A reward offered for completing specific tasks or projects within the Jutsu platform. Builders can earn tokens by successfully fulfilling these bounties.
-   **Builder Studio**: The suite of tools provided by Jutsu, enabling users to design and create AI agents with ease using no-code and low-code solutions.
-   **Decentralized**: A system where control and decision-making are distributed among a network of participants rather than centralized in a single entity.
-   **ERC-20**: A standard for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that ensures interoperability between different tokens and applications. The Jutsu Token (JUT) follows this standard.
-   **Governance**: The process of making decisions about the rules and direction of the platform, often involving community voting and consensus.
-   **Jutsu Platform**: The comprehensive AI agent platform that allows users to create, deploy, and monetize AI applications with no-code tools and robust support.
-   **Low-Code/No-Code**: Development approaches that allow users to create applications or agents with minimal or no programming knowledge, using intuitive interfaces and visual tools.
-   **Marketplace**: A section of the Jutsu platform where users can publish and monetize their AI agents.
-   **Micro-Royalty**: A small, continuous payment that builders receive based on the usage and engagement of their agents. This ensures fair compensation for their contributions.
-   **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)**: A unique digital asset that represents ownership of a specific item or piece of content, often used to verify ownership and provenance in digital art and collectibles.
-   **Staking**: The process of locking up tokens to support the operations of a blockchain network or platform, often earning rewards in return.
-   **Tokenomics**: The economic model and structure governing the distribution, utilization, and management of tokens within the Jutsu platform.
-   **User Dashboard**: The interface where users can manage their AI agents, access Builder Studio, and track performance metrics.
-   **Validator**: A participant in the blockchain network responsible for verifying transactions and maintaining the integrity of the ledger.
-   **Wallet**: A digital tool used to store, manage, and transact cryptocurrencies and tokens. In Jutsu, wallets are used to hold JUT tokens and interact with the platform.

### Key Features and Capabilities

-   **Multi-modal Context Support**: The ability of AI agents to understand and process inputs from various modes such as text, images, and voice.
-   **Fine-tuning**: Customizing a pre-trained AI model with specific data to improve its performance on particular tasks.
-   **Interaction Modes**: Different ways AI agents can interact with users, including text, speech, and visual inputs.
-   **Horizontal Scalability**: The ability to add more AI agents to handle increased workload without affecting performance.
-   **Vertical Scalability**: Enhancing the capabilities and processing power of existing AI agents to handle more complex tasks.
-   **Self-Improvement (Reflection)**: The process by which AI agents regularly assess and improve their performance, similar to human self-review.
-   **Tool Integration**: The ability to incorporate external tools and resources, such as web search APIs and data processing utilities, to enhance AI agent functionality.

### Security and Compliance

-   **Data Encryption**: The method of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access.
-   **GDPR Compliance**: Adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation, a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal data within the European Union (EU).
-   **Privacy Policy**: A statement that explains how Jutsu collects, uses, and protects user data.
-   **Access Control**: Mechanisms that restrict access to data and functionalities to authorized users only.
-   **Audit Trail**: A record that shows who has accessed a computer system and what operations they have performed during a given period.

### Common Processes

-   **Training**: The process of teaching an AI model to perform specific tasks by feeding it data and adjusting its parameters.
-   **Deployment**: The process of making an AI agent available for use in a real-world environment.
-   **Monitoring**: Continuously tracking the performance and behavior of AI agents to ensure they are operating correctly.
-   **Feedback Loop**: A system for collecting and analyzing user feedback to improve AI agent performance over time.
-   **Version Control**: A system that records changes to files or a set of files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later.

### Creative and Advanced Concepts

-   **Generative AI**: AI that can generate new content, such as text, images, or music, based on learned patterns from existing data.
-   **Federated Learning**: A machine learning technique where a model is trained across multiple decentralized devices using local data samples without exchanging them.
-   **Reinforcement Learning**: A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties.
-   **Explainability**: The ability to understand and interpret the decisions made by an AI agent.
-   **Ethical AI**: The practice of developing AI systems that are fair, transparent, and accountable.
-   **Energy-Efficient AI**: Developing AI systems that consume less power and resources, reducing their environmental impact.
-   **Zero-Shot Learning**: An aspect of machine learning where a model can recognize and classify data it has never seen before.
