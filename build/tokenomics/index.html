<p>The tokenomics of the Jutsu Ecosystem are designed to create a sustainable, incentivized environment that supports the continuous development, deployment, and monetization of AI apps. Central to this model is the Jutsu Token (JUT), an ERC-20 token that facilitates transactions, rewards contributions, and enables governance within the community.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-features">Key Features<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Features" title="Direct link to Key Features" href="/tokenomics#key-features">​</a></h3>
<p>JUT tokens are used as the primary currency within the ecosystem, facilitating transactions across all core systems. Builders can earn tokens through the creation and adoption of AI apps. These tokens can be reinvested into the platform to access premium tools and services, creating a continuous cycle of innovation and engagement.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="marketplace-economics">Marketplace Economics<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Marketplace Economics" title="Direct link to Marketplace Economics" href="/tokenomics#marketplace-economics">​</a></h3>
<p>The Marketplace enables builders to publish and monetize their AI apps. Builders can earn revenue through interactions and subscriptions, while micro-royalties are distributed based on app usage. This dynamic and collaborative environment incentivizes high-quality content creation and enhances the overall ecosystem.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="innovation-rewards">Innovation Rewards<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Innovation Rewards" title="Direct link to Innovation Rewards" href="/tokenomics#innovation-rewards">​</a></h3>
<p>The Innovation Portal focuses on fostering innovation and ensuring quality assurance. Builders are rewarded for completing bounty tasks that address specific platform requirements. Tokens are staked to create bounties, and successful completion releases these staked tokens as rewards to the builders. Curators play a crucial role by verifying and approving the completion of tasks, ensuring adherence to quality standards.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="governance-participation">Governance Participation<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Governance Participation" title="Direct link to Governance Participation" href="/tokenomics#governance-participation">​</a></h3>

<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="purpose">Purpose<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Purpose" title="Direct link to Purpose" href="/tokenomics#purpose">​</a></h5>
<p>The Reward Pool is designed to incentivize and reward builders and curators who contribute meaningfully to the ecosystem. It facilitates a performance-driven reward system that values the quality, frequency, and impact of contributions.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="allocation">Allocation<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Allocation" title="Direct link to Allocation" href="/tokenomics#allocation">​</a></h5>
<p>45% of the total token supply will be reserved for the Reward Pool, ensuring a sustained ability to incentivize and reward contributions over time.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="strategy">Strategy<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Strategy" title="Direct link to Strategy" href="/tokenomics#strategy">​</a></h5>
<p>The Reward Pool supports various incentive mechanisms within the Jutsu Ecosystem. This includes micro-royalties for builders based on the usage of their AI apps and rewards for curators who ensure the quality and relevance of ecosystem contributions. Additionally, it provides initial rewards to builders who onboard and successfully complete their first project.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementation">Implementation<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation" title="Direct link to Implementation" href="/tokenomics#implementation">​</a></h5>
<p>To effectively implement the Reward Pool, we will establish a detailed process of new token issuance driven by the ecosystem’s subscriber pool, along with periodic reviews to adjust the reward system based on ecosystem needs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Micro-Royalties Distribution:</strong> Whenever an AI Worker is used, a micro-royalty fee is generated and sent to the Reward Pool. The smart contract then distributes these fees to the original builder based on usage metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation Rewards:</strong> Builders who complete bounties will receive their rewards as a percentage of the staked tokens, which are allocated from the Reward Pool. This ensures that successful bounty completions are directly rewarded. Curators receive tokens for their review and vetting activities. The amount of tokens allocated is based on the quality and reliability of their reviews, measured by community feedback and other performance metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Fees Reallocation:</strong> A percentage of all transaction fees generated within the ecosystem is automatically redirected to the Reward Pool, ensuring that the pool is continually replenished. This mechanism helps sustain long-term incentives without depleting the pool.</li>
<li><strong>Periodic Reviews:</strong> A governance committee will conduct quarterly reviews to assess the performance of the reward formula and make necessary adjustments. These reviews will be informed by ecosystem data and user feedback, ensuring the reward system remains aligned with ecosystem goals and user expectations.</li>
</ul>

<p>20% of the total token supply is allocated to the Operational Reserve, providing a robust financial buffer to facilitate smooth operations and enable agile responses to unforeseen needs or opportunities.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="strategy-1">Strategy<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Strategy" title="Direct link to Strategy" href="/tokenomics#strategy-1">​</a></h5>
<p>The governance committee will oversee the reserve, with quarterly assessments to reallocate funds based on operational milestones, financial forecasts, and strategic priorities.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementation-1">Implementation<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation" title="Direct link to Implementation" href="/tokenomics#implementation-1">​</a></h5>
<p>Implementing the operational reserve involves forming a governance committee, defining key milestones, and conducting financial forecasting to ensure appropriate fund allocations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governance Committee:</strong> The established governance committee, consisting of senior ecosystem managers and community representatives. This committee will oversee the allocation of funds and ensure that resources are used effectively to support the platform’s growth and stability.</li>
<li><strong>Milestone-Based Reallocation:</strong> Key operational milestones will be defined, such as major software updates and infrastructure upgrades. Funds will be allocated based on the completion of these milestones. For example, 10% of the reserve might be allocated for a software update, with funds released once the update is successfully deployed.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Forecasting:</strong> Predictive analytics tools will be utilized to generate regular financial forecasts. These forecasts will anticipate future expenses and ensure reserve adequacy, informing the committee’s decisions on fund allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Quarterly Assessments:</strong> Quarterly reviews of financial reports will be conducted, and fund allocations will be adjusted as needed based on current needs and strategic priorities. Assessment reports will be published to maintain transparency, providing the community with insight into how funds are being utilized.</li>

<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="allocation-3">Allocation<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Allocation" title="Direct link to Allocation" href="/tokenomics#allocation-3">​</a></h5>
<p>15% of the total token supply is reserved for stakeholders, which helps in securing their support while preventing abrupt market fluctuations by implementing vesting schedules and lock-up periods.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="strategy-3">Strategy<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Strategy" title="Direct link to Strategy" href="/tokenomics#strategy-3">​</a></h5>
<p>Stakeholder tokens are distributed under a structured vesting plan that spans 2-4 years to prevent market flooding and ensure stakeholders are incentivized over the long term. The distribution strategy includes regular assessments to adjust vesting schedules based on individual and collective contributions to the ecosystem’s success.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementation-3">Implementation<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation" title="Direct link to Implementation" href="/tokenomics#implementation-3">​</a></h5>
<p>The implementation of stakeholder incentives involves creating a comprehensive vesting plan, establishing lock-up periods, and conducting regular assessments to ensure alignment with ecosystem goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vesting Plan:</strong> The vesting plan for stakeholder incentives is designed to ensure a long-term commitment to the platform. Stakeholders will have their tokens vested over a period of 2 to 4 years, with tokens being released quarterly. For example, if a stakeholder is allocated 1,000 tokens to be vested over two years, they will receive 125 tokens each quarter. There will be an initial cliff period of one year, meaning stakeholders will not receive any tokens until they have been with the platform for at least one year. After this cliff period, the remaining tokens will be distributed quarterly. This plan ensures that stakeholders are rewarded for their sustained involvement and support.</li>
<li><strong>Lock-Up Periods:</strong> To align stakeholders&#x27; interests with the long-term success of the ecosystem, initial lock-up periods will be implemented. A lock-up period of 6 to 12 months will prevent stakeholders from selling or transferring their tokens during this initial period. After the initial lock-up, tokens will be gradually released according to the vesting schedule. For instance, if a stakeholder has a 12-month lock-up, they will start receiving their tokens quarterly after the lock-up period ends. This approach helps maintain market stability and ensures that stakeholders remain committed to the ecosystem’s growth.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Assessments:</strong> Regular assessments will be conducted to ensure the vesting and lock-up periods are effective and fair. The governance committee will perform quarterly reviews to assess the vesting schedules&#x27; effectiveness based on the ecosystem’s performance, stakeholder contributions, and evolving market conditions. Detailed assessment reports will be published to maintain transparency, outlining the number of tokens vested, release dates, and any adjustments made. These reviews and reports ensure stakeholders understand the value of their contributions and the rationale behind any changes in the vesting plan.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Vesting Schedule:</strong> Each stakeholder will receive a personalized vesting schedule, providing clear visibility into the vesting process. For instance, an investor allocated 2,000 tokens over four years with a one-year cliff period will receive 500 tokens per year, distributed quarterly. Stakeholders will be regularly informed about their vesting schedules, including any changes made during the quarterly assessments. This detailed schedule helps stakeholders plan their contributions and align their efforts with the platform’s strategic goals.</li>

<p>The Initial Token Distribution is intended to establish initial market liquidity and incentivize early developers who are critical to the ecosystem&#x27;s initial development and growth. This strategic distribution is designed to quickly ramp up a robust and productive developer ecosystem, while ensuring a broad and fair token distribution at launch.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="allocation-4">Allocation<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Allocation" title="Direct link to Allocation" href="/tokenomics#allocation-4">​</a></h5>
<p>5% of the total token supply is designated for initial distribution, with 2% allocated for the public sale and 3% specifically reserved for developer onboarding incentives. This targeted approach not only seeds the market with initial liquidity but also directly supports Jutsu’s goal of fostering an active and innovative developer community from the outset.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="strategy-4">Strategy<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Strategy" title="Direct link to Strategy" href="/tokenomics#strategy-4">​</a></h5>
<p>The public sale will be conducted in a staged and transparent manner, complying with regulatory guidelines to establish a baseline market value for the tokens. Simultaneously, the builder onboarding program will allocate tokens to early builders who sign up on Jutsu and are evaluated for their potential to contribute meaningfully to the ecosystem.</p>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementation-4">Implementation<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation" title="Direct link to Implementation" href="/tokenomics#implementation-4">​</a></h5>
<p>To effectively implement the initial token distribution, we will conduct the public sale in stages, ensure regulatory compliance, and provide incentives for early developers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Sale Stages:</strong> The public sale will be conducted in multiple stages, including a private pre-sale, a public pre-sale, and a main sale. Each stage will have a capped token amount to prevent over-subscription and ensure a fair distribution. The private pre-sale will offer a limited amount of tokens to strategic investors and partners, followed by a public pre-sale open to a broader audience at a discounted rate. The main sale will be the final stage with a fixed token price, ensuring broad access to the tokens while establishing a baseline market value.</li>
<li><strong>Builder Onboarding:</strong> To incentivize early developers, token grants will be provided upon successful registration and project approval. For example, 500 tokens will be awarded to each early builder who registers and completes their first project. This approach encourages immediate and impactful participation from developers, helping to build a robust ecosystem from the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance Measures:</strong> To ensure regulatory compliance, KYC and AML checks will be implemented for all participants in the public sale. This includes verifying the identity of participants and ensuring adherence to regulatory guidelines across all jurisdictions. Implementing these measures will help maintain the integrity of the token sale process and ensure it meets global regulatory standards.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Regular updates will be provided to the community on the progress of the token sale and onboarding process. Detailed reports on token allocation and distribution will be published to maintain transparency. This includes providing information on the number of tokens sold in each stage, the participants involved, and the remaining token supply. By maintaining transparency, we ensure community trust and engagement throughout the initial distribution phase.</li>
