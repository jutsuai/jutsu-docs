# Challenges

The development of intelligent software agents and dApps is hindered by several significant challenges:

- **Demand for Next-Generation Platforms**: There is a strong need for platforms specifically designed for AI-driven development to address the unique challenges of the generative AI era.
- **Inadequate Development Tools**: Existing tools are not optimized for the generative AI era, lacking features and capabilities needed for AI-driven development.
- **Monetization Difficulties**: Developers struggle to monetize their contributions effectively, limiting their ability to sustain and scale projects.
- **Resource Accessibility**: There is a need for integrated access to unique AI-driven developer tools, provider hosted models, and other supporting infrastructure that enhance development efficiency and application quality.
- **Lack of Developer Workflows**: Insufficient workflows for building, deploying, and maintaining software complicates the development process.
- **Ineffective Incentive Structures**: Traditional platforms fail to provide adequate incentives to reward developers, curators, and providers, leading to diminished motivation and engagement.
- **Lacking Interoperability Standards**: The absence of accepted standards for agent workflows and interoperability hinders seamless integration and coordination of various agents and applications.
- **Transparency and Trust Issues**: Many platforms struggle with maintaining transparency in their operations, undermining user trust and economic stability.
