# Focus

The initial focus of Jutsu is to facilitate the creation and deployment of decentralized applications (dApps) on an AI-native developer platform. This platform will provide intelligent workflows and tools aiding in the development and deployment of smart contracts and on-chain frontend components. These workflows will simplify development with agent-driven tools that work with users to help developers reduce time-spent, complexity, and cost of development.
