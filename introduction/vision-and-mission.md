# Vision and Mission

## Vision

Jutsu envisions its platform evolving into an agent marketplace formed by its bedrock open infrastructure for orchestrating and executing generalized AI-driven workflows. This platform evolution will add software agents to the existing template registry, further empowering the development, composition, deployment, and management of an infinite variety of intelligent applications. Ultimately, this platform will facilitate sustainable and transparent community interactions through an incentivized economy of users, developers, providers, and curators while encouraging right-action and continuous engagement.

## Mission

The mission of Jutsu is to lower entry barriers and foster a dynamic environment where developers can thrive and contribute to the platform's continuous evolution. By simplifying complex processes and supporting a range of developer workflows and tools, Jutsu aims to transform how developers create, deploy, and monetize intelligent software agents and decentralized applications.
